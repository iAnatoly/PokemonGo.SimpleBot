# Simple Bot for Pokemon Go

Built on top of FeroxRev's Pokemon-Go-Rocket-API (https://github.com/FeroxRev/Pokemon-Go-Rocket-API),
 which is included as a submodule (so do not forget to do 'git submodule init' upon cloning).

This is a simple bot with simple logic - walk around at speeds acheivable by humans, visit pocketops, catch pokemons.

Features: 
- movemenmt randomization
- human speed (configurable)
- myopic decision-making (walking to the closest pokestop/pokemon first)
- movement logging via GPX
