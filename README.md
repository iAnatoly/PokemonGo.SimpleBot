# Simple Bot for Pokemon Go

Built on top of [FeroxRev's Pokemon-Go-Rocket-API](https://github.com/FeroxRev/Pokemon-Go-Rocket-API), which is included as a submodule (so do not forget to do `git submodule init && git submodule update` upon cloning).

This is a simple bot with simple logic - walk around at speeds acheivable by humans, visit pocketops, catch pokemons.

###Features: 
* movemenmt randomization
* delay randomization
* human-like randomized movement speed
* myopic decision-making (walking to the closest pokestop/pokemon first)
* movement log via GPX

###Sample GPX trail for the bot:
